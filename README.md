# REQUERIMENTS 🔧
· Have a code editor (optional)

# HOW TO RUN ✔️
1. Open the file and you'll have it there, if you have a plugin in *vscode* or other editor you can use that


# WARNING ⚠️
**If you are going to change anything, makes sure that matches in every file (script.js, styles.css), because it can give you errors.**
